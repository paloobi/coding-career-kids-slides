						<p>Today, you’ll be learning how to code.</p>
						
						<p>I’m here to talk to you about what I do for a living.</p>

						<p>Software Engineer at Facebook, previously Netflix.</p>
						
						<p>What I love about my job is that I get to use code that helps connect people with their friends and families, and work together with a lot of really smart and creative people who want to bring people closer together.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Well, my job has a lot of different names.</p>

						<p>This might seem confusing - it is for me too! My job has a lot of different names.</p>

						<p>But the basic thing you need to know is that I write code every day - and the code I write is used to make websites. Let’s talk a little about where those other job names mean, so I can give you an idea of what I do every day.</p>

					<p>
						<span>Build</span>
						<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">the part of websites that live on your computer.</span>
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Well, we already know what an Engineer is.</p>

						<p>The thing is, a website is built from a lot of different parts. Some of those parts are on your computer or phone - but some of them are on another computer somewhere else!</p>

						<p>Every time you use the Web, your computer or phone is talking to a ton of other computers all at once just make the website work. Those other computers are usually called the “Back End” - so the “Front End” is the part of the website that runs on your computer or phone.</p>

						<p>What part lives on your computer?</p>

						<p>Well, a lot of stuff! Everything you see or hear on the website itself - text, images, links, videos. My job is to think about how things look, make sure the website is fast when you move around and try to do things, and hopefully making it fun and easy to use too!</p>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>Developer = This is basically just another word for Engineer, or for someone who makes things.</p>

					<p>Web = Remember when I mentioned that your computer talks to a lot of computers all at once when you look at a website? Well the “Web” is the name we give for all of those computers talking to each other.</p>

					<p>And the Web is not just websites! You can access the Web with apps on your smartphone or your tablet, when you talk to Alexa, when you play games, or use a virtual reality headset, or maybe even TV or your refrigerator!! All of those things are built by engineers like me.</p>

				<p>What do I do at work?</p>
				<section>
					<p>🗣 Talk to people</p>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						Meet and talk with other people on my team - designers, researchers, and other engineers - figure out what are the most helpful things we can build
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>❤️ Help people</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						I also meet one-on-one with my boss, and with other people on my team, to ask for help, or to learn how I can help my teammates, or sometimes just to catch up and say hi!

					<p>☕️ Coffee Chats</p>
			
					<aside class="notes">
						I go to coffee chats with my whole team over video chat twice a week
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>👩🏻‍💻 Video Coworking with my team</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Work remotely with my team once a week - we turn on our video chat and mostly hang out and chat while we code. This is great, because a big part of my job is asking a lot of questions, and also answering other people’s questions. Software engineers help each other a lot, because every software engineer knows different things.
					</aside>

				<section>
					<p>📖 Learn new things</p>
				
					<aside class="notes">
						I spend time trying to learn new things. In technology, things change really fast! There are always new things to learn, and better ways to do things. So that’s also part of my job.
					</aside>

				<section>
					<p>🎲 Play games with my team</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						On Fridays, we play games together over video chat, just for fun! Or we share what we've been working on and celebrate each other's hard work!
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>🔍 Read other people's code</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I review other people’s code, to check for mistakes (they do the same for me!)</p>

						<p>I also spend a lot of time reading and looking at other people’s code to get ideas for how to do things in better ways. And if someone wrote a piece of code that I can use, I’m expected to use it instead of making it up all over again. </p>

						<p>Think of it like building things with blocks. Most of the time, you can use the blocks that you already have. But every now and then, you might want to build something special - maybe a fancy roof, or a mailbox. Then you might need to make a new block!</p>

						<p>So what do I do when I need to make a new block? I write code!</p>

					What are the ways you can tell your computer or your phone what to do?

					You can use a mouse
					You could type something in your keyboard
					You can use the touch screen on your phone
					You can talk to Siri or Alexa

					Your computer can do a lot of things already. But what if you want the computer to do something it doesn’t know how to do yet?

					<p>Writing Code = Teach Your Computer How To Do New Things</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Your computer can learn to do things that it doesn’t know how to do yet, just like you.

						What makes coding a little tricky is that when you're talking to a computer, it doesn't understand you the same way a person would.

					<aside class="notes">
						What happened here??

						Unfortunately, even though computers can do a LOT, they really aren't as smart as you and me. The computer doesn't speak any human languages - it does not know what you meant when you said to put two slices together. And it can only do things it understands.</p>

						<p>So if you want to teach the computer how to do things it doesn’t know how to do yet, you need to learn how to speak it’s language. And you need to figure out what to do when it doesn't understand what you tell it to do. That's what coding is all about</p>

						<p>Sharing instructions in a language your computers understand. You can use code to teach your computer how to do new things!</p>

					So so so much!

					Code is everywhere - and Code is used in every single industry and field of study! Don’t believe me?

Video Games - video games are made out of code

Medicine - they use code for research and analysis to understand and discover new medicines

Government - help people get services like healthcare or food stamps; and also to help the government understand the problems they’re trying to solve

Theatre - code is used to run the lights and the sound for theatre productions!

Writing & literature - code is used to format ebooks, to distribute books, and for bookstores and libraries to manage their collections

Film & Movies - Visual effects, sound effects are made of code. Code also powers all the software used by screenwriters, the cameras used to film, and for things like video editing - at Netflix, code is also used to help people find movies and TV shows they want to watch

Music - electronic music! You can even make music directly in your web browser with code! But code is also baked into almost all the equipment you see on stage at a concert - and many of the instruments, like electronic keyboards!

Video - YouTube, Netflix, TikTok - all of these sites are made out of code! Streaming technology is really difficult, and there are still a lot of problems that need to be solved to make sure that the videos are able to load while you watch them.

Military Defense - hackers from other countries sometimes try to attack our government or people’s computers! There are people whose job it is to defend us from those attacks using code! Also, the military has been at the forefront of many technological advances. Admiral Grace Hopper invented the first human-readable programming language - before her, you had to talk to computers in their language directly.

Airplanes & spaceships - all of the equipment that makes airplanes and spaceships fly or navigate uses code. In fact, a woman named Margaret Hamilton led the team of Software Engineers who wrote the code that sent the first astronauts to the moon!!

Cars - cars have computers inside them - and code is the thing that makes them keep working, and also lets the driver know if they need to be taken into the shop. Add now, with recent invention of self-driving cars, there is even more code being used to power cars!

Factories - a lot of manufacturing is done with robots, and robots need to be coded so they can run properly.

Even the tools used by other kinds of engineers - like architects - are made out of code.
