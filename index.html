					<p>I wasn’t always a coder! I used to hate math and science - I didn’t think I was good at them.</p>

					<p>[NEXT] When I was a kid, I was really excited about acting. I wanted to be an actor when I grew up, and when I went to college I decided to study acting because it was my favorite activity in school. But there are a lot of different parts of every job. And when I finished studying acting in college, I realized that there were some parts of the acting job that I really didn’t like. So I decided to make a change.</p>

					<p>[NEXT] One thing I knew I was really good at in college, and that I liked, was writing, so I become a writer for a few years. That was the first time I got excited about technology and computers. I realized I had been using these things all my life - to make art, to write, to stay in touch with my friends - but I had no idea how they worked! So I starting trying to figure out how computers and the Internet work.</p>

					<p>And the more I learned, the more I wanted to learn! I started reading a lot, and started trying to learn how to make a website.</p>

					<p>I got a job my first job involving code: [NEXT] I become a technical writer. Every day I got paid to learn about the Internet & computers & software, and write about what I learned. I learned all about the machines and software that power the Internet. And I got to work with a lot of software engineers for the first time. After a while, I realized that I wanted to start making software myself!</p>

					<p>So I started teaching myself to code. It was really hard learning all by myself. I had a couple friends I could ask for help, and I was able to use a lot of free resources I found online (like the ones you're going to use today!). After a while, I decided I wanted to go back to school so I could learn enough to get my first software engineering job.</p>

					<p>[NEXT] So I went to the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy, in New York City. All-women school that teaches you everything you need to know to start working as a web developer. I got to learn side-by-side with some really amazing women. And I finally learned how to build software for the web!</p>

					<p>After the program, I started working as a [NEXT] software engineer! So far, I’ve worked at Facebook & Netflix. I really love my job! I get to do all the things I love - I get to write about code, I get to use my theater background when I give presentations and talks like these. And best of all, I have time at the end of my work day to do other things I love too - like play games with my friends and write stories.</p>

					<p>Some people realize they love to code when they’re younger. And other people decide they like coding much later in life. I hope you'll enjoy your coding experience today. It's okay if you don't fall in love with it right away. It’s never too late to learn to code! But I’m so excited for all of you that you get the chance to explore it now, like I wish I had the chance to when I was younger!</p>

				<p>What does a software engineer do every day?</p>
				<section>
					<p>🗣 Talk to people</p>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						Meet and talk with other people on my team - designers, researchers, and other engineers - figure out what are the most helpful things we can build
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>❤️ Help people on my team</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						I also meet one-on-one with my boss, and with other people on my team, to ask for help, or to learn how I can help my teammates, or sometimes just to catch up and say hi!

					<p>☕️ Coffee Chats</p>
			
					<aside class="notes">
						I go to coffee chats with my whole team over video chat twice a week
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>👩🏻‍💻 Video coworking with my team</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Work remotely with my team once a week - we turn on our video chat and mostly hang out and chat while we code. This is great, because a big part of my job is asking a lot of questions, and also answering other people’s questions. Software engineers help each other a lot, because every software engineer knows different things.

				<section>
					<p>📖 Learn new things</p>
				
					<aside class="notes">
						I spend time trying to learn new things. In technology, things change really fast! There are always new things to learn, and better ways to do things. So that’s also part of my job.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>👩🏻‍💻 Read & Write Code!</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I review other people’s code, to check for mistakes (they do the same for me!)</p>

						<p>I also spend a lot of time reading and looking at other people’s code to get ideas for how to do things in better ways. And if someone wrote a piece of code that I can use, I’m expected to use it instead of making it up all over again. </p>

						<p>Think of it like building things with blocks. Most of the time, you can use the blocks that you already have. But every now and then, you might want to build something special - maybe a fancy roof, or a mailbox. Then you might need to make a new block!</p>

						<p>So what do I do when I need to make a new block? I write code!</p>

					<p>Teach Your Computer To Do New Things</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Your computer can learn to do things that it doesn’t know how to do yet, just like you.

						What makes coding a little tricky is that when you're talking to a computer, it doesn't understand you the same way a person would.

						What happened here??

						Unfortunately, even though computers can do a LOT, they really aren't as smart as you and me. The computer doesn't speak any human languages - it does not know what you meant when you said to put two slices together. And it can only do things it understands.</p>

						<p>So if you want to teach the computer how to do things it doesn’t know how to do yet, you need to learn how to speak it’s language. And you need to figure out what to do when it doesn't understand what you tell it to do. That's what coding is all about</p>

					<p>Once you know how to tell the computer what you want it to do, you'd be surprised at just how many things you can use code for!</p>

					<p>Code is everywhere - and Code is used in every single industry and field of study! Don’t believe me?</p>

Video Games - video games are made out of code

Medicine - they use code for research and analysis to understand and discover new medicines

Government - help people get services like healthcare or food stamps; and also to help the government understand the problems they’re trying to solve

Theatre - code is used to run the lights and the sound for theatre productions!

Writing & literature - code is used to format ebooks, to distribute books, and for bookstores and libraries to manage their collections

Film & Movies - Visual effects, sound effects are made of code. Code also powers all the software used by screenwriters, the cameras used to film, and for things like video editing - at Netflix, code is also used to help people find movies and TV shows they want to watch

Music - electronic music! You can even make music directly in your web browser with code! But code is also baked into almost all the equipment you see on stage at a concert - and many of the instruments, like electronic keyboards!

Video - YouTube, Netflix, TikTok - all of these sites are made out of code! Streaming technology is really difficult, and there are still a lot of problems that need to be solved to make sure that the videos are able to load while you watch them.

Military Defense - hackers from other countries sometimes try to attack our government or people’s computers! There are people whose job it is to defend us from those attacks using code! Also, the military has been at the forefront of many technological advances. Admiral Grace Hopper invented the first human-readable programming language - before her, you had to talk to computers in their language directly.

Airplanes & spaceships - all of the equipment that makes airplanes and spaceships fly or navigate uses code. In fact, a woman named Margaret Hamilton led the team of Software Engineers who wrote the code that sent the first astronauts to the moon!!

Cars - cars have computers inside them - and code is the thing that makes them keep working, and also lets the driver know if they need to be taken into the shop. Add now, with recent invention of self-driving cars, there is even more code being used to power cars!

Factories - a lot of manufacturing is done with robots, and robots need to be coded so they can run properly.

Even the tools used by other kinds of engineers - like architects - are made out of code.
