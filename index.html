						<p>What kinds of things?</p>
						<p>Can any of you think of examples of kinds of software?</p>

						<p>All of these are examples of software.</p>

						<p>Which means they are code that runs on your computer (or phone or TV) that lets you do something - like watch a movie, or play a game</p>

						<p>Someone somewhere had to write code to make all of these things work</p>

					<p>I wasn’t always a coder! I used to hate math and science - I didn’t think I was good at them.</p>

					<p>[NEXT] When I was a kid, I really wanted to be an actor when I grew up. So I went to college to study theater and acting. The thing is, there are a lot of different parts of every job. And when I finished studying acting in college, I realized that there were some parts of the acting job that I really didn’t like. I realized I wanted to do something else.</p>

					<p>[NEXT] One thing I knew I was really good at in college, and that I liked, was writing, so I become a writer for a few years. That was the first time I got excited about technology and computers. I realized I had been using these things all my life - to make art, to write, to stay in touch with my friends - but I had no idea how they worked! So I starting trying to figure out how computers and the Internet work. [SCROLL FIRST]</p>

					<p>And the more I learned, the more I wanted to learn! I started reading a lot, and started trying to learn how to make a website.</p>

					<p>I got a job my first job involving code: [NEXT] I become a technical writer. Every day I got paid to learn about the Internet & computers & software, and write about what I learned. I learned all about the machines and software that power the Internet. And I got to work with a lot of software engineers for the first time. After a while, I realized I didn't just want to write about software- I wanted to learn how to make software!</p>

					<p>[NEXT] So I started teaching myself to code. It was really hard learning all by myself. I had a couple friends I could ask for help, and I was able to use a lot of free resources I found online (like the ones you're going to use today!). After a while, I decided I wanted to go back to school so I could learn enough to get my first software engineering job.</p>

					<p>[NEXT] So I went to the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy, in New York City. All-women school that taught me everything I needed to know to start working as a software engineer. I got to learn side-by-side with some really amazing women. And I finally learned how to build software for the web!</p>

					<p>After graduating, I started working as a [NEXT] software engineer! So far, I’ve worked at Facebook & Netflix. I really love my job! I get to do all the things I love - I get to solve people's problems using code, I get to write about code, I get to use my acting background when I give presentations and talks like these. And best of all, I have time at the end of my work day to do other things I love too - like play games with my friends and write stories.</p>

					<p>Some people realize they love to code when they’re younger. And other people decide they like coding much later in life. I hope you'll enjoy your coding experience today. It's okay if you don't fall in love with it right away. It’s never too late to learn to code! But I’m so excited for all of you that you get the chance to explore it now, like I wish I had the chance to when I was younger! I didn't know how to get started!</p>

				</ul>
				
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>[NEXT] Meet and talk with people I work with - other engineers, but also designers, writers - </p>
					<p>[NEXT] I also meet one-on-one with my boss, and with other people on my team, to ask for help, or to learn how I can help my teammates, or sometimes just to catch up and say hi!</p>
					<p>[NEXT] Solve problems. Find the most helpful things we can build for people</p>
					<p>[NEXT] coffee chats w the team</p>
					<p>[NEXT] turn on our video chat and hang out and chat while we code together. This is great, because a big part of my job is asking a lot of questions, and also answering other people’s questions. Software engineers help each other a lot, because every software engineer knows different things.</p>
					<p>[NEXT] In technology, things change really fast! There are always new things to learn, and better ways to do things. So that’s also part of my job.</p>
					<p>[NEXT] I read other people’s code, to check for mistakes (they do the same for me!)</p>

					<p>I also look at other people’s code to get ideas for how to do things in better ways. And if someone wrote a piece of code that I can use, I’m expected to use it instead of making it up all over again.</p>

					<p>Think of it like building things with blocks. Most of the time, you can use the blocks that you already have, or maybe buy some new blocks. But every now and then, you might want to build something really special - maybe a fancy roof, or a mailbox. Then you might need to make a new block!</p>

					<p>So what do I do when I need to make a new block? That's when I write code!</p>

					<p>Teach Your Computer To Do New Things</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Your computer can learn to do things that it doesn’t know how to do yet, just like you.

						What makes coding a little tricky is that when you're talking to a computer, it doesn't understand you the same way a person would.

						What happened here??

						Unfortunately, even though computers can do a LOT, they really aren't as smart as you and me. The computer doesn't speak any human languages - it does not know what you meant when you said to put two slices together. And it can only do things it understands.</p>

						<p>So if you want to teach the computer how to do things it doesn’t know how to do yet, you need to learn how to speak it’s language. And you need to figure out what to do when it doesn't understand what you tell it to do. That's what coding is all about</p>
